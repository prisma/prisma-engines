Servers can use it to ask clients to refresh the code lenses currently shown in editors. As a result the client should ask the server to recompute the code lenses for these editors.

Completion items are presented in the IntelliSense user interface. If computing full completion items is expensive, servers can additionally provide a handler for the completion item resolve request (‘completionItem/resolve’). This request is sent when a completion item is selected in the user interface. A typical use case is for example: the ‘textDocument/completion’ request doesn’t fill in the documentation property for returned completion items since it is expensive to compute. When the item is selected in the user interface then a ‘completionItem/resolve’ request is sent with the selected completion item as a param. The returned completion item should have the documentation property filled in. The request can delay the computation of the detail and documentation properties. However, properties that are needed for the initial sorting and filtering, like sortText, filterText, insertText, and textEdit must be provided in the textDocument/completion request and must not be changed during resolve."],["DocumentColor","The document color request is sent from the client to the server to list all color references found in a given text document. Along with the range, a color value in RGB is returned."],["DocumentHighlightRequest","The document highlight request is sent from the client to the server to resolve a document highlights for a given text document position. For programming languages this usually highlights all references to the symbol scoped to this file. However we kept ‘textDocument/documentHighlight’ and ‘textDocument/references’ separate requests since the first one is allowed to be more fuzzy.
