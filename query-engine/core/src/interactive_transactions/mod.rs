/// How Interactive Transactions work
/// The Interactive Transactions (iTx) follow an actor model design. Where each iTx is created in its own process.
/// When a prisma client requests to start a new transaction, the Transaction Actor Manager spawns a new ITXServer. The ITXServer runs in its own
/// process and waits for messages to arrive via its receive channel to process.
/// The Transaction Actor Manager will also create an ITXClient and add it to hashmap managed by an RwLock. The ITXClient is the only way to communicate
/// with the ITXServer.
///
/// Once Prisma Client receives the iTx Id it can perform database operations using that iTx id. When an operation request is received by the
/// TransactionActorManager, it looks for the client in the hashmap and passes the operation to the client. The ITXClient sends a message to the
/// ITXServer and waits for a response. The ITXServer will then perform the operation and return the result. The ITXServer will perform one
/// operation at a time. All other operations will sit in the message queue waiting to be processed.
///
/// The ITXServer will handle all messages until:
/// - It transitions state, e.g "rollback" or "commit"
/// - It exceeds its timeout, in which case the iTx is rolledback and the connection to the database is closed.
///
/// Once the ITXServer is done handling messages from the iTx Client, it sends a last message to the Background Client list Actor to say that it is completed and then shuts down.
/// The Background Client list Actor removes the client from the list of active clients and keeps in cache the iTx id of the closed transaction.
///
/// We keep a list of closed transactions so that if any further messages are received for this iTx id,
/// the TransactionActorManager can reply with a helpful error message which explains that no operation can be performed on a closed transaction
/// rather than an error message stating that the transaction does not exist.
