//! What the executor module DOES:
//! - Defining an overarching executor trait, to be used on consumers of the core crate.
//! - Defining executor implementations that combine the different core modules into a coherent
//!   string of actions to execute a given query document.
//!
//! What the executor module DOES NOT DO:
//! - Define low level execution of queries. This is considered an implementation detail of the modules used by the executors.
