description = """
Try to make the database empty: no data and no schema. On most connectors, this
is implemented by dropping and recreating the database. If that fails (most
likely because of insufficient permissions), the engine attemps a \"best effort
reset\" by inspecting the contents of the database and dropping them
individually.

Drop and recreate the database. The migrations will not be applied, as it would
overlap with `applyMigrations`.
