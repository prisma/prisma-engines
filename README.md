[![Cargo docs](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/actions/workflows/cargo-doc.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/actions/workflows/cargo-doc.yml)

This repository contains a collection of engines that power the core stack for
[Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma), most prominently [Prisma
Client](https://www.prisma.io/client) and [Prisma
Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate).

The engines and their respective binary crates are:

- Query engine: `query-engine`
- Migration engine: `migration-engine-cli`
- Introspection engine: `introspection-engine`
- Prisma Format: `prisma-fmt`

## Documentation

The [API docs (cargo doc)](https://prisma.github.io/prisma-engines/) are
published on the repo GitHub pages.

## Building Prisma Engines

**Prerequisites:**

- Installed the stable Rust toolchain, at least version 1.52.0. You can get the
  toolchain at [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or the package manager of your
  choice.
- Linux only: OpenSSL is required to be installed.
- Installed [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), then `direnv allow` on
  the repository root.
  - Make sure direnv is [hooked](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) into your shell
  - Alternatively: Load the defined environment in `./.envrc` manually in your
    shell.
- **For m1 users**: Install [Protocol Buffers](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

**How to build:**

To build all engines, simply execute `cargo build` on the repository root. This
builds non-production debug binaries. If you want to build the optimized
binaries in release mode, the command is `cargo build --release`.

Depending on how you invoked `cargo` in the previous step, you can find the
compiled binaries inside the repository root in the `target/debug` (without
`--release`) or `target/release` directories (with `--release`):

| Prisma Component     | Path to Binary                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Query Engine         | `./target/[debug\|release]/query-engine`         |
| Migration Engine     | `./target/[debug\|release]/migration-engine`     |
| Introspection Engine | `./target/[debug\|release]/introspection-engine` |
| Prisma Format        | `./target/[debug\|release]/prisma-fmt`           |

## Query Engine

### Usage

The Query Engine can be run as a graphql server without using the Prisma Client.
If using it on production please be aware the api and the query language can
change any time. There is no guaranteed API stability.

Notable environment flags:

- `RUST_LOG_FORMAT=(devel|json)` sets the log format. By default outputs `json`.
- `QE_LOG_LEVEL=(info|debug|trace)` sets the log level for the Query Engine. If you need Query Graph debugging logs, set it to "trace"
- `FMT_SQL=1` enables logging _formatted_ SQL queries
- `PRISMA_DML_PATH=[path_to_datamodel_file]` should point to the datamodel file
  location. This or `PRISMA_DML` is required for the Query Engine to run.
- `PRISMA_DML=[base64_encoded_datamodel]` an alternative way to provide a
  datamodel for the server.
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=(0|1)` if set to 1, the error backtraces will be printed to
  the STDERR.
- `LOG_QUERIES=[anything]` if set, the SQL queries will be written to the `INFO`
  log. Needs the right log level enabled to be seen from the terminal.
- `RUST_LOG=[filter]` sets the filter for the logger. Can be either `trace`,
  `debug`, `info`, `warning` or `error`, that will output ALL logs from every
  crate from that level. The `.envrc` in this repo shows how to log different
  parts of the system in a more granular way.

Starting the Query Engine:

The engine can be started either with using the `cargo` build tool, or
pre-building a binary and running it directly. If using `cargo`, replace
whatever command that starts with `./query-engine` with `cargo run --bin query-engine --`.

**Help**

```bash
> ./target/release/query-engine --help

The prisma version hash is the latest git commit at the time the binary was built.

## Metrics

Running `make show-metrics` will start Prometheus and Grafana with a default metrics dashboard.
Prometheus will scrape the `/metrics` endpoint to collect the engine's metrics

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Grafana dashboard.

## Testing

There are two test suites for the engines: Unit tests and
integration tests.

- **Unit tests**: They test internal
  functionality of individual crates and components.

  You can find them across the whole codebase, usually in `./tests` folders at the root of modules.

- **Integration tests**: They run GraphQL queries against isolated
  instances of the Query Engine and asserts that the responses are correct.

  You can find them at `./query-engine/connector-test-kit-rs`.

### Set up & run tests:

**Prerequisites:**

- Installed Rust toolchain.
- Installed Docker and Docker-Compose.
- Installed `direnv`, then `direnv allow` on the repository root.
  - Alternatively: Load the defined environment in `./.envrc` manually in your shell.

**Setup:**
There are helper `make` commands to set up a test environment for a specific
database connector you want to test. The commands set up a container (if needed)
and write the `.test_config` file, which is picked up by the integration
tests:

- `make dev-mysql`: MySQL 5.7
- `make dev-mysql8`: MySQL 8
- `make dev-postgres`: PostgreSQL 10
- `make dev-sqlite`: SQLite
- `make dev-mongodb5`: MongoDB 5

\*_On windows:_
If not using WSL, `make` is not available and you should just see what your
command does and do it manually. Basically this means editing the
`.test_config` file and starting the needed Docker containers.

To actually get the tests working, read the contents of `.envrc`. Then `Edit environment variables for your account` from Windows settings, and add at least
the correct values for the following variables:

- `WORKSPACE_ROOT` should point to the root directory of `prisma-engines` project.
- `PRISMA_BINARY_PATH` is usually
  `%WORKSPACE_ROOT%\target\release\query-engine.exe`.
- `MIGRATION_ENGINE_BINARY_PATH` should be
  `%WORKSPACE_ROOT%\target\release\migration-engine.exe`.

Other variables may or may not be useful.

**Run:**

Run `cargo test` in the repository root.

## Parallel rust-analyzer builds

When rust-analzyer runs `cargo check` it will lock the build directory and stop any cargo commands from running until it has completed. This makes the build process feel a lot longer. It is possible to avoid this by setting a different build path for
rust-analyzer. To avoid this. Open VSCode settings and search for `Check on Save: Extra Args`. Look for the `Rust-analyzer â€º Check On Save: Extra Args` settings and add a new directory for rust-analyzer. Something like:

```
--target-dir:/tmp/rust-analyzer-check
```

### Automated integration releases from this repository to npm

(Since July 2022). Any branch name starting with `integration/` will, first, run the full test suite and, second, if passing, run the publish pipeline (build and upload engines to S3)

The journey through the pipeline is the same as a commit on the `main` branch.
- It will trigger [prisma/engines-wrapper](https://github.com/prisma/engines-wrapper) and publish a new [`@prisma/engines-version`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/engines-version) npm package but on the `integration` tag.
- Which triggers [prisma/prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) to create a `chore(Automated Integration PR): [...]` PR with a branch name also starting with `integration/`
- Since in prisma/prisma we also trigger the publish pipeline when a branch name starts with `integration/`, this will publish all prisma/prisma monorepo packages to npm on the `integration` tag.
- Our [ecosystem-tests](https://github.com/prisma/ecosystem-tests/) tests will automatically pick up this new version and run tests, results will show in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/prisma/ecosystem-tests/actions?query=branch%3Aintegration)

This end to end will take minimum ~1h20 to complete, but is completely automated :robot:

Notes:
- in prisma/prisma repository, we do not run tests for `integration/` branches, it is much faster and also means that there is no risk of test failing (e.g. flaky tests, snapshots) that would stop the publishing process.
- in prisma/prisma-engines tests must first pass, before publishing starts. So better keep an eye on them and restart them as needed.
