This repository contains a collection of engines that power the core stack for
[Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma), most prominently [Prisma
Client](https://www.prisma.io/client) and [Prisma
Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/migrate).

If you're looking for how to install Prisma or any of the engines, the [Getting
Started](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) guide might be useful.

This document describes some of the internals of the engines, and how to build
and test them.

## What's in this repository

This repository contains four engines:

- _Query engine_, used by the client to run database queries from Prisma Client
- _Schema engine_, used to create and run migrations and introspection
- _Prisma Format_, used to format prisma files

Additionally, the _psl_ (Prisma Schema Language) is the library that defines how
the language looks like, how it's parsed, etc.

You'll also find:

- _libs_, for various (small) libraries such as macros, user facing errors,
  various connector/database-specific libraries, etc.
- a `docker-compose.yml` file that's helpful for running tests and bringing up
  containers for various databases
- a `flake.nix` file for bringing up all dependencies and making it easy to
  build the code in this repository (the use of this file and `nix` is
  entirely optional, but can be a good and easy way to get started)
- an `.envrc` file to make it easier to set everything up, including the `nix
shell`

## Documentation

The [API docs (cargo doc)](https://prisma.github.io/prisma-engines/) are
published on our fabulous repo page.

## Building Prisma Engines

**Prerequisites:**

- Installed the latest stable version of the Rust toolchain. You can get the
  toolchain at [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or the package manager of your
  choice.
- Linux only: OpenSSL is required to be installed.
- Installed [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), then `direnv allow` on
  the repository root.
  - Make sure direnv is [hooked](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) into your shell
  - Alternatively: Load the defined environment in `./.envrc` manually in your
    shell.
- **For m1 users**: Install [Protocol Buffers](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

Note for nix users: it should be enough to `direnv allow`.
**How to build:**

To build all engines, simply execute `cargo build` on the repository root. This
builds non-production debug binaries. If you want to build the optimized
binaries in release mode, the command is `cargo build --release`.

Depending on how you invoked `cargo` in the previous step, you can find the
compiled binaries inside the repository root in the `target/debug` (without
`--release`) or `target/release` directories (with `--release`):

| Prisma Component | Path to Binary                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Query Engine     | `./target/[debug\|release]/query-engine`  |
| Schema Engine    | `./target/[debug\|release]/schema-engine` |
| Prisma Format    | `./target/[debug\|release]/prisma-fmt`    |

## Prisma Schema Language

The _Prisma Schema Language_ is a library which defines the data structures and
parsing rules for prisma files, including the available database connectors. For
more technical details, please check the [library README](./psl/README.md).

The PSL is used throughout the schema engine, as well as
prisma format. The DataModeL (DML), which is an annotated version of the PSL is
also used as input for the query engine.

## Query Engine

The _Query Engine_ is how Prisma Client queries are executed. Here's a brief
description of what it does:

- takes as inputs an annotated version of the Prisma Schema file called the
  DataModeL (DML),
- using the DML (specifically, the datasources and providers), it builds up a
  [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) model for queries and responses,
- runs as a server listening for GraphQL queries,
- it translates the queries to the respective native datasource(s) and
  returns GraphQL responses, and
- handles all connections and communication with the native databases.

When used through Prisma Client, there are two ways for the Query Engine to
be executed:

- as a binary, downloaded during installation, launched at runtime;
  communication happens via HTTP (`./query-engine/query-engine`)
- as a native, platform-specific Node.js addon; also downloaded during
  installation (`./query-engine/query-engine-node-api`)

### Usage

You can also run the Query Engine as a stand-alone GraphQL server.

**Warning**: There is no guaranteed API stability. If using it on production
please be aware the api and the query language can change any time.

Notable environment flags:

- `RUST_LOG_FORMAT=(devel|json)` sets the log format. By default outputs `json`.
- `QE_LOG_LEVEL=(info|debug|trace)` sets the log level for the Query Engine. If
  you need Query Graph debugging logs, set it to "trace"
- `FMT_SQL=1` enables logging _formatted_ SQL queries
- `PRISMA_DML_PATH=[path_to_datamodel_file]` should point to the datamodel file
  location. This or `PRISMA_DML` is required for the Query Engine to run.
- `PRISMA_DML=[base64_encoded_datamodel]` an alternative way to provide a
  datamodel for the server.
- `RUST_BACKTRACE=(0|1)` if set to 1, the error backtraces will be printed to
  the STDERR.
- `LOG_QUERIES=[anything]` if set, the SQL queries will be written to the `INFO`
  log. Needs the right log level enabled to be seen from the terminal.
- `RUST_LOG=[filter]` sets the filter for the logger. Can be either `trace`,
  `debug`, `info`, `warning` or `error`, that will output ALL logs from every
  crate from that level. The `.envrc` in this repo shows how to log different
  parts of the system in a more granular way.

Starting the Query Engine:

The engine can be started either with using the `cargo` build tool, or
pre-building a binary and running it directly. If using `cargo`, replace
whatever command that starts with `./query-engine` with `cargo run --bin query-engine --`.

You can also pass `--help` to find out more options to run the engine.

### Metrics

Running `make show-metrics` will start Prometheus and Grafana with a default metrics dashboard.
Prometheus will scrape the `/metrics` endpoint to collect the engine's metrics

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Grafana dashboard.

## Schema Engine

The _Schema Engine_ does a couple of things:

- creates new migrations by comparing the prisma file with the current state of
  the database, in order to bring the database in sync with the prisma file
- run these migrations and keeps track of which migrations have been executed
- (re-)generate a prisma schema file starting from a live database

The engine uses:

- the prisma files, as the source of truth
- the database it connects to, for diffing and running migrations, as well as
  keeping track of migrations in the `_prisma_migrations` table
- the `prisma/migrations` directory which acts as a database of existing
  migrations

## Prisma format

Prisma format can format prisma schema files. It also comes as a WASM module via
a node package. You can read more [here](./prisma-schema-wasm/README.md).

## Debugging

When trying to debug code, here's a few things that might be useful:

- use the language server; being able to go to definition and reason about code
  can make things a lot easier,
- add `dbg!()` statements to validate code paths, inspect variables, etc.,
- you can control the amount of logs you see, and where they come from using the
  `RUST_LOG` environment variable; see [the documentation](https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.9.1/env_logger/#enabling-logging),
- you can use the `test-cli` to test migration and introspection without having
  to go through the `prisma` npm package.

## Testing

There are two test suites for the engines: Unit tests and
integration tests.

- **Unit tests**: They test internal
  functionality of individual crates and components.

  You can find them across the whole codebase, usually in `./tests` folders at
  the root of modules. These tests can be executed via `cargo test`. Note that
  some of them will require the `TEST_DATABASE_URL` environment variable set up.

- **Integration tests**: They run GraphQL queries against isolated
  instances of the Query Engine and asserts that the responses are correct.

  You can find them at `./query-engine/connector-test-kit-rs`.

### Set up & run tests:

**Prerequisites:**

- Installed Rust toolchain.
- Installed Docker.
- Installed `direnv`, then `direnv allow` on the repository root.
  - Alternatively: Load the defined environment in `./.envrc` manually in your shell.

**Setup:**

There are helper `make` commands to set up a test environment for a specific
database connector you want to test. The commands set up a container (if needed)
and write the `.test_config` file, which is picked up by the integration
tests:

- `make dev-mysql`: MySQL 5.7
- `make dev-mysql8`: MySQL 8
- `make dev-postgres`: PostgreSQL 10
- `make dev-sqlite`: SQLite
- `make dev-mongodb_5`: MongoDB 5

\*_On windows:_
If not using WSL, `make` is not available and you should just see what your
command does and do it manually. Basically this means editing the
`.test_config` file and starting the needed Docker containers.

To actually get the tests working, read the contents of `.envrc`. Then `Edit environment variables for your account` from Windows settings, and add at least
the correct values for the following variables:

- `WORKSPACE_ROOT` should point to the root directory of `prisma-engines` project.
- `PRISMA_BINARY_PATH` is usually
  `%WORKSPACE_ROOT%\target\release\query-engine.exe`.
- `SCHEMA_ENGINE_BINARY_PATH` should be
  `%WORKSPACE_ROOT%\target\release\schema-engine.exe`.

Other variables may or may not be useful.

**Run:**

Run `cargo test` in the repository root.

### Testing driver adapters

Please refer to the [Testing driver adapters](./query-engine/connector-test-kit-rs/README.md#testing-driver-adapters) section in the connector-test-kit-rs README.

**ℹ️ Important note on developing features that require changes to the both the query engine, and driver adapters code**

As explained in [Testing driver adapters](./query-engine/connector-test-kit-rs/README.md#testing-driver-adapters), running `DRIVER_ADAPTER=$adapter make qe-test`
will ensure you have prisma checked out in your filesystem in the same directory as prisma-engines. This is needed because the driver adapters code is symlinked in prisma-engines.

When working on a feature or bugfix spanning adapters code and query-engine code, you will need to open sibling PRs in `prisma/prisma` and `prisma/prisma-engines` respectively.
Locally, each time you run `DRIVER_ADAPTER=$adapter make test-qe` tests will run using the driver adapters built from the source code in the working copy of prisma/prisma. All good.

In CI, tho', we need to denote which branch of prisma/prisma we want to use for tests. In CI, there's no working copy of prisma/prisma before tests run.
The CI jobs clones prisma/prisma `main` branch by default, which doesn't include your local changes. To test in integration, we can tell CI to use the branch of prisma/prisma containing
the changes in adapters. To do it, you can use a simple convention in commit messages. Like this:

```
git commit -m "DRIVER_ADAPTERS_BRANCH=prisma-branch-with-changes-in-adapters [...]"
```

GitHub actions will then pick up the branch name and use it to clone that branch's code of prisma/prisma, and build the driver adapters code from there.

When it's time to merge the sibling PRs, you'll need to merge the prisma/prisma PR first, so when merging the engines PR you have the code of the adapters ready in prisma/prisma `main` branch.

### Testing engines in `prisma/prisma`

You can trigger releases from this repository to npm that can be used for testing the engines in `prisma/prisma` either automatically or manually:

#### Automated integration releases from this repository to npm

(Since July 2022). Any branch name starting with `integration/` will, first, run the full test suite in Buildkite `[Test] Prisma Engines` and, second, if passing, run the publish pipeline (build and upload engines to S3 & R2)

The journey through the pipeline is the same as a commit on the `main` branch.

- It will trigger [`prisma/engines-wrapper`](https://github.com/prisma/engines-wrapper) and publish a new [`@prisma/engines-version`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/engines-version) npm package but on the `integration` tag.
- Which triggers [`prisma/prisma`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) to create a `chore(Automated Integration PR): [...]` PR with a branch name also starting with `integration/`
- Since in `prisma/prisma` we also trigger the publish pipeline when a branch name starts with `integration/`, this will publish all `prisma/prisma` monorepo packages to npm on the `integration` tag.
- Our [ecosystem-tests](https://github.com/prisma/ecosystem-tests/) tests will automatically pick up this new version and run tests, results will show in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/prisma/ecosystem-tests/actions?query=branch%3Aintegration)

This end to end will take minimum ~1h20 to complete, but is completely automated :robot:

Notes:

- in `prisma/prisma` repository, we do not run tests for `integration/` branches, it is much faster and also means that there is no risk of tests failing (e.g. flaky tests, snapshots) that would stop the publishing process.
- in `prisma/prisma-engines` the Buildkite test pipeline must first pass, then the engines will be built and uploaded to our storage via the Buildkite release pipeline. These 2 pipelines can fail for different reasons, it's recommended to keep an eye on them (check notifications in Slack) and restart jobs as needed. Finally, it will trigger [`prisma/engines-wrapper`](https://github.com/prisma/engines-wrapper).

#### Manual integration releases from this repository to npm

Additionally to the automated integration release for `integration/` branches, you can also trigger a publish **manually** in the Buildkite `[Test] Prisma Engines` job if that succeeds for _any_ branch name. Click "🚀 Publish binaries" at the bottom of the test list to unlock the publishing step. When all the jobs in `[Release] Prisma Engines` succeed, you also have to unlock the next step by clicking "🚀 Publish client". This will then trigger the same journey as described above.

## Parallel rust-analyzer builds

When rust-analzyer runs `cargo check` it will lock the build directory and stop any cargo commands from running until it has completed. This makes the build process feel a lot longer. It is possible to avoid this by setting a different build path for
rust-analyzer. To avoid this. Open VSCode settings and search for `Check on Save: Extra Args`. Look for the `Rust-analyzer › Check On Save: Extra Args` settings and add a new directory for rust-analyzer. Something like:

```
--target-dir:/tmp/rust-analyzer-check
```

## Community PRs: create a local branch for a branch coming from a fork

To trigger an [Automated integration releases from this repository to npm](#automated-integration-releases-from-this-repository-to-npm) or [Manual integration releases from this repository to npm](#manual-integration-releases-from-this-repository-to-npm) branches of forks need to be pulled into this repository so the Buildkite job is triggered. You can use these GitHub and git CLI commands to achieve that easily:

```
gh pr checkout 4375
git checkout -b integration/sql-nested-transactions
git push --set-upstream origin integration/sql-nested-transactions
```

If there is a need to re-create this branch because it has been updated, deleting it and re-creating will make sure the content is identical and avoid any conflicts.

```
git branch --delete integration/sql-nested-transactions
gh pr checkout 4375
git checkout -b integration/sql-nested-transactions
git push --set-upstream origin integration/sql-nested-transactions --force
```
