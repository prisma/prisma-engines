When running a Prisma CLI command that needs the database connection URL (e.g. `prisma db pull`), you need to make sure that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set. One way to do so is by creating a `.env` file. Note that the file must be in the same directory as your schema.prisma file to automatically be picked up by the Prisma CLI.\"\n\n_@param_ environmentVariable The environment variable in which the database connection URL is stored."
