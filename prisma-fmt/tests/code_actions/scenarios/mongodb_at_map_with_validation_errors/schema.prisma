  // relies on the parser database to be fully populated and all attributes
  // to be resolved, however when there are name and type resolution errors,
  // the attributes are not currently resolved and only an empty stub for
  // model attributes is constructed. This may change in the future, and this
  // test expectation would need to be updated correspondingly then.
  //
  // Note that the validation error itself does not appear here too until the
  // error on the next line is fixed (due to these being separate validation
  // passes), so the behaviour is consistent.
