Development command for migrations. Evaluate the data loss induced by the next
migration the engine would generate on the main database.

At this stage, the engine does not create or mutate anything in the database

This is part of the `migrate dev` flow.

**Note**: the engine currently assumes the main database schema is up-to-date
with the migration history.
