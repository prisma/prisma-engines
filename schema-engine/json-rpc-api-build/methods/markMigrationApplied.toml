description = """Mark a migration as applied in the migrations table.

There are two possible outcomes:

- The migration is already in the table, but in a failed state. In this case, we will mark it
  as rolled back, then create a new entry.
- The migration is not in the table. We will create a new entry in the migrations table. The
  `started_at` and `finished_at` will be the same.
- If it is already applied, we return a user-facing error.
