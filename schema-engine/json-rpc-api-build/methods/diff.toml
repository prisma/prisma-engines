description = """
Compares two databases schemas from two arbitrary sources, and display the
difference as either a human-readable summary, or an executable script that can
be passed to dbExecute.

Connection to a shadow database is only necessary when either the `from` or the
`to` params is a migrations directory.

Diffs have a _direction_. Which source is `from` and which is `to` matters. The
resulting diff should be thought as a migration from the schema in `from` to
the schema in `to`.

By default, we output a human-readable diff. If you want an executable script,
pass the `"script": true` param.
