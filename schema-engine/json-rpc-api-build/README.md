# schema-engine/json-rpc-api-build

The build script implementation for generating documentation and types from the
schema engine JSON-RPC API reference.

The `methods` folder contains the API definition. This should be considered as
a _contract_ with the TypeScript CLI.

The `src` folder contains the build script. This should be considered an
implementation detail of `migration-core`.
